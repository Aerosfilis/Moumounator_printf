How to use:

1-			in main_all.c, change your .h path in the first include, to you ft_printf.h
2-			./Moumounator_printf.sh <../path_to_your_printf> (cspduixX%) (012)
				(sdiuxXp%) =	type to test
								Default: ALL
				(0,1,2) =	0 only display failed tests (Default)
							1 will both display failed and succeed tests
							2 same as 1 but detail for succeed tests
				No flag will test all type, with modified display 1.

			You MUST put a [0, 1, 2] flag, if you put a [sdiuxXp] flag.
